#Standard Move Notation
#An example of understanding the solution in standard notation (for game 10913)
#
##10913 
#26 76 72 72 5a 27 57 67 1b 61 41 4h 4h 41 45 34 3c 6d 5b 
#
#a, b, c, d - free cells, 
#1, 2 .. 8 - columns, 
#h - home cell 
#
#1st move: 26 : move the cards from the 2nd column to the 6th column. 
#5th move = 5a : move a card from the 5th column to the 1st free cell. 
#12th move = 4h : move a card from the 4th column to the home cell. 
#
#All moves to empty columns are column moves rather than single card moves. 
#
#P.S. Many other sites are also using this most popular notation.
#SuperMove
#
#Starting from the Vista version of Windows the standard MS FreeCell program uses "SuperMove" for moving more cards to
#empty column at once. Because of "SuperMove" approximately 4% of the solutions on this site have two versions: one version
#with "SuperMove" (for Windows Vista/7/8) and the second version without "SuperMove" (for Windows XP and older versions).

# columns 1-8, freecells a-d, h for home foundation
#a move consists of a list or tuple of 3 items, (from, to, count)
